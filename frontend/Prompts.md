## 1. A solana web app with pure React frontend and rust backend called Nescrow which uses an escrow logic for wager of multiple use cases
### Response: I understand you want to build "Nescrow" - a Solana web application with an escrow system for wagering across multiple use cases. This involves blockchain integration with a React frontend and Rust backend.

However, I need to let you know that this project involves technologies that aren't available in our current development environment. Specifically:

Rust backend development - Our available stacks don't include Rust
Solana blockchain integration - This requires specialized blockchain development tools
Smart contract development - Escrow logic typically requires on-chain smart contracts
Our available technology stacks are:

FULLSTACK_JS: React frontend with Express.js backend
FLASK_VANILLA_JS: Python Flask backend with vanilla JavaScript frontend
STREAMLIT: Python-based data applications
GAMESTACK_JS: React with Three.js for games
Would you like me to propose an alternative approach? I could create a mock version of Nescrow using React frontend with Express.js backend that simulates the escrow functionality without actual blockchain integration. This would let you:

Design and test the user interface and user experience
Prototype the escrow workflow logic
Create a foundation that could later be integrated with actual Solana smart contracts
The mock version would demonstrate how users interact with escrow contracts for wagering, even though the actual blockchain transactions would be simulated.

Would you like me to proceed with this approach, or would you prefer to work on this project in a different development environment that supports Rust and Solana development?
##2. Build only the react frontend part then, with sleek purple and gold design
### Response: Perfect! I'll create a plan for the React frontend of Nescrow with a sleek purple and gold design. This will be a beautiful interface that showcases the escrow wagering functionality, even though the backend will be mocked for now.
